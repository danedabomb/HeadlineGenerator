# HeadlineGenerator
Generates reasonable headlines based on the words in an article using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Original code forked from https://github.com/udibr/headlines. Worked with David Liedtka, a Naval Cryptologic Warfare Officer and a scholar.

NOTE:
- All .pkl files (data.pkl, vocabulary-embedding.pkl, vocabulary-embedding-data.pkl), our trained weights file (train.hdf5), and our dataset were too large for uploading to GitHub
- We preprocessed our dataset into the data.pkl file using our generate_pkl script
